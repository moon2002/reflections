1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

   when I want to share a project with others or work remotely in collaboration with a team
   
2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    I might not want to include changes in the remote repository
    For example, the changes in one branch is for review and sharing only
    I don't have permission to modify

3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you use one instead of another?

    Fork: clone a repository by someone else on GitHub, 
    my changes only affect my fork and won't affect the original one
    Clone: copy a repository from a remote location, "push" will affect the original repository
    Branch: when I don't need the repository with all its history
    creating a branch will enable me to work from the current commit
    future changes might affect the parent of my branch  

4. What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    It enables me to download all the latest changes from the remote while not merging them with the changes I created locally

5. How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

 

6. When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
