How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

    A diff highlights all changes made in the new version. 
    I can then look for the bug within a much smaller area.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I will be able to track all changes and fix bugs easily. 
    It will also be easier to collaborate with others on a project. 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pros: i am in control; 
    avoid creating a commit in the middle of a change;
    avoid too many commits;
    create a commit for change around one theme

    cons: i need to remember to commit;
    and the remember to commit at the right time 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Saving related files together is more efficient. 
    It makes tracking changes that rely one other files easier.
